# Flask App Demo

This is a full-featured demo Flask application demonstrating:

-  US address geocoding with chart and Google Maps integration
-  AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT API
-  Estimating interface with dynamic forms and cost calculations
-  User-supplied API key fields for OpenAI and Google Maps (no secrets stored)

---

##  Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
