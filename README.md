#  Portfolio Scripts

This repository contains a curated collection of development scripts, prototypes, and CLI tools built to showcase my engineering capabilities and architectural thinking. Each folder represents a standalone or testable utility, touching on areas like backend systems, automation, cloud-native development, encryption, and data handling.

---

##  Purpose

The goal of this repository is to highlight:

- My ability to structure code clearly and modularly
- A focus on developer experience and testability
- Practical patterns used in production systems
- Deep comfort with Python, CLI design, AWS services, and security-conscious development

Each project is self-contained, well-documented, and ready to run or test locally.

---

##  Features You Might Find

- End-to-end CLI tools for file encryption, data loading, or cloud interactions
- Boto3 integrations with local or mocked AWS services
- Pytest test suites with isolated environments
- Click-powered user interfaces
- Clean error handling and security by default

---

##  Structure

Each folder contains:

- `README.md` and/or `dev.md` for usage + internal documentation
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- Source scripts under clean, modular package layouts
- Tests under `tests/`, with mocks or Docker as needed

---

##  Running Code

Most tools work with:

```bash
python -m <module> [command]

Featured Projects

File Encryption and Vault CLI
Built a secure Python CLI tool for encrypting and managing files. Integrated AES-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation. Used Click for an intuitive command-line interface, with attention to authentication tag handling and IV generation.

PII Scanner CLI
Developed a zero-dependency CLI tool that scans files or text for PII, including emails, SSNs, phone numbers, and AWS tokens. Supports structural scoring, regex detection, and JSON/plain-text reporting. Designed for use in CI pipelines or local audits.

Track Data Importer (CSV to SQLite)
Automated the ingestion of CSV files into a normalized SQLite database. Created dynamic schemas, enforced relationships with foreign keys, and generated summary reports for validation.

Job Costing Estimator
CLI-based tool to calculate project labor, materials, and overhead. Structured using a reusable Python class. Ideal for small service businesses needing quick, accurate estimates.

XML Data Summarizer
Fetched XML from web endpoints, parsed <comments><count> elements, and returned statistical summaries. Emphasis on error handling and clarity of output.

Flask-Based Web Applications
Designed and deployed Flask applications for small business needs, including:
	•	Estimating and quoting systems
	•	CRM and lead tracking
	•	Data dashboards and inventory tools
Implemented dynamic form handling and OpenAI API integration.
